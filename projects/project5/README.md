Hello, hello! Here I will break down the structures I chose to use for each function and component. 

1. Menu
For the menu, I decided that it would be best if I used a fixed Array to store the data. I would store the drink (with all it's related information) in an object. Thus is would be a fixed array of objects, that could be iterated over to display each of the drinks and their price/ingredients.
2. Customer Orders
I know that for the customer orders, it would probably be best to store it in a queue (since that has the First in First out function) but for my program I decided to use a linked list. This is because a linked list allows for the program to remove elements from the list. I wanted to implement one of the bonus features. Additionally, all orders will be stored in a list, this is so users can see what has been previously ordered, and reorder it.
